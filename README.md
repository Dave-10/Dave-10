Hi, 
Iâ€™m Dave.
New to Github and how to use it.
Am interested at the moment in programming the PIC16F1459
to do interupt driven I2C (using MPLABX's MCC as a start).
Just managed to make this happen with an SSD1306 I2C driven display.
Am now looking to understand the USB protocols and hopefully set it up
so it can present to a PC as a Comm port USB connection.
Once again starting with MCC.
Not a hot shot C or C++ programmer by any means so am also learning,
what are to me, tricky data structures etc associated with the driver code "API?" interface.
